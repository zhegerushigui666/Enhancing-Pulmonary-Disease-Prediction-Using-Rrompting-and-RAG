The `new_retriever.py` is designed to run SHAP analysis. If you wish to freely determine the retrieval mode for Milvus, you can utilize the functions within it. All requests in `delivery.py` default to dual-path recall. Additionally, we have placed all prompts under the `role` because, based on our testing, the performance under `role` is better. We have observed that in some communities, there are already some similar experiences with prompt tuning.
